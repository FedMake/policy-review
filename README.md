## What is a FedMake Accelerator

A FedMake Accelerator is a minimal viable product (MVP) of a solution initially created at a FedMake for the government, by the government, solving challenges unique to the government.  It is intended to be a starting point for an organization to take and implement the features necessary for them.  They are verified to work in the government community cloud (GCC) and potentialy in the high cloud (GCCH) and/or depatment of defense (DoD) cloud.

## Feedback & Issues

FedMake Accelerators are supported by the open source community on a *best effort* basis.  They are not Microsoft products and therefore do not have the same support that they do.  If your organization has a support contract with Microsoft, you may be able to utilze it for any questions or issues you may have.

Please report bugs and other code issues [here](https://github.com/FedMake/policy-review/issues/new).

## Data Residency

All data in the FedMake Accelerator resides only within the tenant it was deployed to.
